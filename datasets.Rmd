My work so far: My data comes from a variety of sources that includes the CDC,
academic research, and a pharmaceutical company.

I have spent most of my time cleaning the data and ensuring that all of the
disparate graphs and tables are in proper form so that I can run analysis. My
work so far has looked like this:


1. Gather data and store on my computer 

2. Create GitHub repo which can be found here:
https://github.com/jrmorse/final_project_datasets

3. Load data into my .rmd


4. scrape data from a website into my RMD. Here I had to spend a lot time
ensuring that the format was correct. This meant getting rid of the costs for
diseases that I wasnâ€™t interested in, converting characters to integers, and
segmenting between direct and indirect medical costs.


5.  I made a function to run through a folder in my repo and to automatically,
pull, clean, and combine data referring to PrEP usage in the U.S.


6. I made a quick bar graph to show the increase of usage between men and women
between 2012-2018.


7. Then I read in, cleaned, and reformatted all CDC data for HIV and other
relevant STIs.

*Please see below for the tables I have created*

```{r all costs}
# This includes the direct medical costs associated with key STIs in the U.S.. I
# will be looking at the costs of HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and I think
# syphilis as well. The prices listed are in 2006 USD, so I will create another
# column that calculates the 2019 USD cost for each infection.I have used the
# pivot long function to create a new column relating to sex. The data should be
# clean and I have used the slice function to get rid of unwanted rows.

  clean_names() %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  slice(4:17)

# This is where I have made sex a new column so that I can better compare costs
# of illness for men and women. Additionally I have created a column to adjust
# 2006 USD to that of 2020 USD. The rate of inflation between the years was
# 131%.

# In the following r blocks I will separate out the indirectand direct costs so
# that I can be more specific.
